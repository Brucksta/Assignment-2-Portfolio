<h1> Week Two Homework Assignment- Personal Portfolio </h1>

To become a candidate for many jobs within the feild of web developement, I need to have a portfolio to showcase my skills. So this is my portfolio!
I've started off with a basic sketch on paper to create a basic wireframe. Having a rough format to work with, I began writing the HTML so that I could have some elements to play with. I set up my headings and wrote my about me paragraph, as well as added my contact details for my contact me section. I then decided ill start my portfolio off as a grid, allowing me to have 2 columns, 1 for titles and headings, and the other for my actual content. 

I coded in all my pictures, set them into containers as parent divs, and then called my child divs boxes. The container would start the mould for the grid, and the boxes would be where I could add content and then shape them how I wanted. I set a nice border to the left of the content, which allowed me to have a straight line seperating the two different sections which gave the portfolio a nice flow.

I then ran into the issue of needing it to be responsive for all sorts of platforms. Id set all the boxes and columns to work as fractions, so when the pages are resized they can easily keep their format. The sizing id gone with for my desktop version (which I started with) however, wouldnt easily work on a phone. I realised i needed to add Media queries to allow the content to mould itself around to fit the smaller screen size. I used flex wrap to allow the columns to flow down, and allow the website to easily scroll on a phone.
